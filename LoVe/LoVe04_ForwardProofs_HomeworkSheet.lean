/- ## Question 1 (6 points): Connectives and Quantifiers

1.1 (3 points). We have proved or stated three of the six possible
implications between `ExcludedMiddle`, `Peirce`, and `DoubleNegation` in the
exercise of lecture 3. Prove the three missing implications using structured
proofs, exploiting the three theorems we already have. -/

#check Peirce_of_EM
#check DN_of_Peirce

theorem Peirce_of_DN :
    DoubleNegation → Peirce :=
  sorry

theorem EM_of_Peirce :
    Peirce → ExcludedMiddle :=
  sorry

theorem dn_of_em :
    ExcludedMiddle → DoubleNegation :=
  sorry

/- 1.2 (3 points). Supply a structured proof of the commutativity of `∧` under
an `∃` quantifier, using no other theorems than the introduction and elimination
rules for `∃`, `∧`, and `↔`. -/

theorem And_comm_under_Exists {α : Type} (p q : α → Prop) :
    (∃x, p x ∧ q x) ↔ (∃x, q x ∧ p x) :=
  sorry


/- ## Question 2 (4 points): Logic Puzzles

Recall the following tactical proof: -/

theorem weak_peirce :
    ∀a b : Prop, ((((a → b) → a) → a) → b) → b :=
  by
    intro a b habaab
    apply habaab
    intro habaa
    apply habaa
    intro ha
    apply habaab
    intro haba
    apply ha

/- 2.1 (2 points). Prove the same theorem again, this time by providing a proof
term.

Hint: There is an easy way. -/

theorem weak_peirce_term :
    ∀a b : Prop, ((((a → b) → a) → a) → b) → b :=
  sorry

/- 2.2 (2 points). Prove the same theorem again, this time by providing a
structured proof, with `fix`, `assume`, and `show`. -/

theorem weak_peirce_struct :
    ∀a b : Prop, ((((a → b) → a) → a) → b) → b :=
  sorry
